I am currently a PhD candidate supervised by Prof. Weiming Zhang and [Assistant Prof. Yun Zhou](https://yzhou.github.io/) in [c2-group](https://c2-group.github.io/) of the school of System Engineering, [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/), China. Prior to that, I obtained my master degree from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in June 2018, working with [Prof. Jianfeng Li](https://www.mech.sdu.edu.cn/info/1127/121173.htm) and [Prof. Jie Sun](https://www.mech.sdu.edu.cn/info/1127/121121.htm), China. I completed my undergraduate study in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://msec.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/), China.

I am interested in the overlap of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Cybersecurity, which includes Information Extraction of Cybersecurity Data, Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph, Users’ Behavior Analysis in Cyberspace, Deep Transfer Learning, Few-shot Learning in NLP. Specifically, my recent researches concern on the construction and completion of Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph—based on information extraction from multi-source heterogeneous text data of web with the support of structured prior knowledge, and on utilizing Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph for malware comparison with the method of subgraph matching, and for knowledge reasoning with DNN.
